      <p>
        From the beginning of my journey as a designer & developer. I've always
        been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My skills are
        broad: from <b> UX </b> to <b> UI </b>, <b>Front end</b> to{" "}
        <b> Back end </b>development. I enjoy each aspect, & love building
        products from start to finish, for clients all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done remote work for business owners, consulted for startups, and
        produced digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm
        quietly confident, naturally curious, & perpetually improving my chops.
