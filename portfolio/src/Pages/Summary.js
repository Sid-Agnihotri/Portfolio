        <p>
          From the beginning of my journey as a designer & developer. I've
          always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My
          skills are broad: from <b> UX </b> to <b> UI </b>, <b>Front end</b> to{" "}
          <b> Back end </b>development. I enjoy each aspect, & love building
          products from start to finish, for clients all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done remote work for business owners, consulted for startups, and
          produced digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm
          quietly confident, naturally curious, & perpetually improving my
          chops.
